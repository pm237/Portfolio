            <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>

            <p>After graduating college with a degree in Mathematics, I became a Math tutor. I taught both high school and college math courses as well teaching some prep exams such as SAT and GMAT. While I love teaching mathematics, I've always loved coding even though I only took 2 or 3 programming courses in college.</p>

            <p>Besides teaching math as a tutor, I have also been teaching myself how to program and that's how I ended up at 
            <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. As a student I have begun my journey to becoming a software developer and I couldn't be happier!</p>

            <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer (or are looking for a partner for a hackathon) please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software.</p>
